		<h2>Fix 1: Efficiency, Simplicity</h2>

		<p>
			A navigation bar should be free from distractions. In this website, the bar contains two different types of
			hyperlinks: 1) sections of the website, 2) highlighted perfume categories. The second group is in conflict
			with the first, and is out of place. Moreover, it is replicated in a very close element under the "BROWSE BY
			CATEGORY" list. This introduces an efficiency issue, as it prevents an experienced user to directly reach
			the content they want to see. Their ability to navigate the website is hindered by the hyperlinks to the
			categories.
		</p>

		<p>
			I fix this issue by removing the second type of hyperlinks from the navigation bar. I also hide the "Follow
			us" section from the body as it is also included in the footer and it does not contribute to the
			functionality of the website. I believe this is a simplicity improvement.
		</p>

			.headernavmenu a.actuator {
				display: none;

			#homepagecolumn3 > div:nth-child(1) {
				display: none;

		<h2>Fix 2: Safety</h2>

		<p>
			The site menu on the left includes a "Log Out" link. This should not be included when the user is not logged
			in, but fixing that is beyond the scope of this exercise. We will focus on a different issue with this link,
			which is that it is blended in the site menu and is very vulnerable to execution errors. A logged in user
			can slip and click the link, logging themselves out without even noticing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I fix this issue by adding contrast to the "Log Out" link.
		</p>

			a[title="Log Out of Web Site"] {
				color: red;
				font-weight: bold;
			}

		<h2>Fix 3: Alignment</h2>

		<p>
			The website has some alignment issues, such as the search element floating left instead of right in the top
			right box, or the "Top Sellers This Week" text being aligned left, which conflicts with the perfumes aligned
			center. I fix these issues.
		</p>

		<code>
			#homepagecolumn3 .productgrid h4 {
				text-align: center;
			}

			#header .headersearch {
				float: right;
			}
		</code>

	<section>
		<h2>Fix 4: Proximity</h2>

		<p>
			Currently, the "Featured products" section and the "Top Sellers This Week" section look too close together
			and there is not enough distance between the two sections. This introduces a proximity issue between the two
			and can lead to the user confusing the contents of the two. I fix this by adding a border between the two
			and adding some padding.
		</p>

		<code>
			#homepagecolumn3 {
				border-left: 2px solid;
				padding-left: 8px;
			}
		</code>

	<section>
		<h2>Fix 5: Contrast</h2>

		<p>
			Even after Fix 4, there is not enough contrast between top sellers and featured products. I fix this by
			adding borders (gold color with repetition in mind) around top sellers to make them even more distinct.
		</p>

		<code>
			#homepagecolumn3 .record {
				border: 2px solid;
				border-color: gold;
				padding: 4px;
			}
		</code>

	<section>
		<h2>Fix 6: Safety</h2>

		<p>
			In comparison to the names of the perfumes, the search bar is very small. As a user types a perfume name to
			search, the beginning of the name will likely disappear to the left. This introduces a security and
			efficiency issue as the system is not tolerant to execution errors such as typos. I fix this by making the
			search bar longer.
